daily todo list within the first 5 minutes and this did turn out to be particularly useful. However,
allowing the mind to wander the rest of the journey is not something that I can recommend to anyone
whose commute is predominately done on a motorway. Motorways are a long boring straight road fill
will cars driving at high speeds, which on at non peak times can be a breeze to drive on, but during
rush hour traffic it's very common to go from 100km down to 10km very quickly. You need to be paying
attention! I noticed a dramatic drop in my reaction times mainly because I was away with the
fairies.`}),`
