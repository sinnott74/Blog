walk the earth to the radical \u2013 and sometimes devastating \u2013 breakthroughs of the Cognitive,
Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology,
paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies,
the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has
unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything,
can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come?`}),`
