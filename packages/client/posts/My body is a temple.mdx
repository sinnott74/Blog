The first personal challenge was battle of will power. I decided that I would consume healthily for
the month. That meant cutting out crisps, chocolate & most importantly alcohol.

### Smooth Sailing

The first two week were a breeze. People generally over consume over the Christmas period so it
fairly easy to not eat chocolate or crisps when you're sitting at home. The biggest temptation I had
was a giant dairy milk bar I was given for Christmas. The bar was is almost 1Kg in weight (850g).
I've included a standard bic pen in the picture for scale.

Its also very easy to not drink over the first two week of January. The run up to Christmas, "Silly
Season", is filled with meeting friends, family & coworkers for a drink. So much so that people
generally take a the first couple weekends of the year to do some R&R.

### Creeping Cravings

As the January week rolled on, it became much more difficult to stick to this.

Snacking was inevitable, but I aimed to control what kind of snack I'd have. If I could find a
"health" alternative, I could eat it.

-   Instead of chips & dip, I'd have crackers & hummus
-   Instead of chocolate, I'd allow myself to have a protein back if it was low in sugar etc.
-   I even convinced myself that a can of Coke Zero can be considerer a healthy alternative to
    regular Coke

Alcohol only became an issue in social situations. I've never really been a bottle of beer midweek
or a glass of wine at dinner type of person, but I do enjoy the ole drop with friends at the
weekend. As you can imagine most social evening events in Dublin have theme of alcohol. The game of
avoiding drink became more about picking & choosing which events to go to. e.g. Meeting a friend in
the pub for one was out of the question.

### Healthy Heedings

Now that the month is over I can reflect. The cravings for chocolate never went away. I almost
caught myself drooling over a picture of an Oreo brownie yesterday, on the last day of the
challenge.

I found myself eating much healthier lunches & dinners as a result, but also noticed that its very
difficult to get good food on the run. Previously I wouldn't have thought twice about about a take
away. There was a noticeable difference in my body fat composition. My weight fell from 82Kg to
80.5Kg.

As for the drink, I never really missed or craved it, but I am looking forward to enjoying a pint
while watching Ireland play France in the first game of the Six Nations this weekend & enjoying the
social setting that alcohol lubricates.

I'm aware of the cyclic nature of food, how somebody can go from eating healthy to being able to
rationalise eating an entire pan of brownies by himself.
