This should be the only challenge declaration that fails rule number 2 (hopefully). January's
challenges were thought up in Dec 2017 and I began them at the beginning of the month, as I intend
to do for each month in 2018.

### Technical

#### Build a blog

The technical challenge for January was to create this blog. I could use any technologies as long as
I deemed them beneficial to my long term learning. E.g. no using WordPress or Blogger etc. The
challenge will be deemed successful if, at the end of the month, I can post, view & edit blog posts
in an easily maintainable way using a web app that works smoothly on both mobile & larger screens.

### Personal

#### Cut the crap

The personal challenge for January was to cut putting crap into my body for the month. This meant no
junk food & most importantly... no alcohol. Ireland was ravaged by Australian Flu over the
Christmas, and I, like everyone else in the country caught it. I began the new year not feeling 100%
and decided I'd take the month to start my year going in the right direction.
