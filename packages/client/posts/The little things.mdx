The challenge for March is to focus on some smaller things.

## Personal

The goal for this month is to get into a routine of taking a multivitamin. Micronutrient, micro, the
little things, get it???

The longterm benefits of taking a multivitamin have been hotly debated.

MVM = multivitamin, FYI

The paper [Vitamin and Mineral Supplements: Do We Really Need Them?] found that:

> The results of large-scale randomized trials show that, for the majority of the population, there
> is no overall benefit from taking MVM supplements. Indeed, some studies have shown increased risk
> of cancers in relation to using certain vitamins.

but

> although in the long run MVMs may slightly increase the risk of cancer and cardiovascular
> diseases, in the short run they produce little harm or no harm, and thus negative consequences
> will not be discernible by individuals taking them.

However the paper [Addressing nutritional gaps with multivitamin and mineral supplements] found
that:

> MVMs may help prevent a number of health problems. In bridging nutrient gaps, it is plausible that
> MVMs help prevent iron-deficiency anemia, neural tube defects, neurological damage in people age
> 50 years and older, and bone disease by supplementing the diet with iron, folic acid, vitamin B12,
> and vitamin D, respectively.

and

> recent studies provided moderate evidence suggesting that MVM supplements containing vitamins and
> minerals at or near the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) are beneficial in reducing the risk of
> chronic disease in at-risk populations, especially given their demonstrated safety

My takeaway from these articles is that you may not know you need a multivitamin and taking one will
do little to no harm. And if all else fails I'm hoping the good ol' placebo effect will give me a
bit of a boost.

A lot of multivitamins contain 100+% of your recommended daily allowance. I've selected a
multivitamin that requires 3 tablets to taken daily, with the aim of taking at most 2 a day.

## Technical

There's several small things about this blog that have bugged me other the past month of interacting
with it. The goal for this month is to fix the following minor UX problems:

-   The navigation bar needs to be personalised
-   Each of these blogs are written in [Markdown], and it's a bit annoying to have to save the blog
    post before I can view how it will look.
