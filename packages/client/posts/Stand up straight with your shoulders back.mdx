I set out this month to improve my posture. Over the past year I'd noticed my daily commute home be
marred by lower back pain. I found my self constantly shifting my seating position in the last
10/15mins of the journey, trying to find a place that my back felt ok with. It was pointed out to me
by a physio friend that I didn't have the best posture & that office life wasn't going to help.

I started out by first looking into office ergonomics & found that if you tilt your office chair ~15
degrees forward it relieves some of the stress on your lower back as its no longer taking all of the
weight of your upper body. Since your legs are now taking some of the slack an added benefit is
improved blood flow. I also started doing more lower back exercises in the gym like the deadlift.
This has certainly helped strengthen my back but I still felt my posture could be better.

I focused on 3 postural areas:

-   Hip flexibility
-   Rounded shoulders
-   Forward neck

### Hip flexibility

For hip flexibility I focused on stretching my hip flexors:

### Rounded shoulders

For rounded shoulders I felt there was an imbalance between my check & my upper back. Relieving some
of the check pressure by doing doorway stretches & increasing my back strength by doing exercise
band pull aparts:

### Forward neck

Finally for forward neck I followed along with the following youtube video:

## Results

The results of this month of consistent stretching can be seen below. Bare in mind that the lighting
is completely different & it's practically impossible to see my hips, but there is still significant
improvement in my shoulders & head.

## Takaway

My takeaway from this month is that I'm no longer a spry young whippersnapper that can afford to not
stretch anymore.

I also reconfirmed the notion that its much easier to not do something that it is to do do (lol).
Its easier to give up something that it is to take up. For January, every time I have the option of
eating unhealthy food I had to make to conscious decision to do it. For February stretches & I had
to set out & intend to stretch, it was something that I could just do in the moment.
