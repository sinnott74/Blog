This month I focuses on regularly taking a multivitamin to see if it would make a difference. I take
the odd Berocca in work if I need a boost ;) but I'd never consistently taken any vitamins.

It's well know that Irish people are a bit deficient in vitamin D due a lack of sunlight. Given that
our spring so far has been worse than our winter, I'd say people are more deficient this year than
most. (It snowed at the beginning & in the middle of MARCH...)

The efficacy is largely up for debate & I linked to a couple of papers debating the topic when I
outlined the [original challenge].

Its pretty important to note here I'm working with a sample size of 1 & its the exact opposite of a
double blind study. Given that the results of this month probably won't be considered for a Nobel
prize.

I felt I was very consistent at a taking the vitamins. Twice a day everyday for the month. During
the third week of the month I genuinely felt they were improving my day to day activities. However
this easily could be attributed to our good friend the placebo effect.

Unfortunately, during the last week I came down with flu like symptoms and that threw any positive
feeling I had toward the vitamins out the window.

This personal challenge is largely inconclusive, but I was impressed with being able to regularly
remember to take my vitamins!

You've got to celebrate small wins whenever you can!
