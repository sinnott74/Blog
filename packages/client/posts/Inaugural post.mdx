## Welcome

Welcome one & all to the first post of this blog. Hopefully the first of many.

We live in a post Trump / Brexit / cryptocurrency world, where so many feel a lack of influence in
the direction the world is moving that generations feel that their only recourse is to tear the
system down & in some ways rage against the machine. I for one, don't share this sentiment. My
thesis is that society has a greater chance of progressing if we take our currently fledgling
systems & attempt to improve on them.

The purpose of this blog is take myself as a microcosm of society at large & apply this thesis.

I enjoy my work as a software engineer; I feel I'm fairly highly skilled, I eat healthily & exercise
regularly; but still there's always so much to improve on both from a technological stand point &
personally.

The goal is here is progressive enhancement.
