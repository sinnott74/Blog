My goal for this month was to fix some small UI/UX issues that I noticed from interacting with the
blog:

-   The navigation bar needs to be personalised
-   Each of these blogs are written in [Markdown], and it's a bit annoying to have to save the blog
    post before I can view how it will look.

## Side Navigation

### Old

The old side navigation needed to be personalised. There's quite a lot history in the side nav. It
was originally built following an [App Shell] tutorial. The side nav then transformed multiple times
depending on the technology I was using at the time. Beginning with a handlebars based app, which
then was converted to a PolymerJS app & now finally built in React. The App Shell title & colourful
image are hangovers from the original side nav until I was fully decided on what should be placed
there.

### New

The new side nav is much cleaner & personalised for myself. Although the side nav doesn't contain a
lot of colour, I feel it's still very vibrant.

Another update that definitely worth mentioning is that blogposts can now be tagged as you'll see
below. This will allow for a nice filtering feature in the future.

## Blog Editor

### Old

The old blog editor was a pain to use. Blogs are written in markdown. So in order for me to preview
if the blog was looking as I would have expected, I had to save the blog post, view it & then click
edit again if I i wanted to continue writing.

### New

The new blog editor is not only much easier to use but it's also much more visually appealing. The
tabs at the top allow the editor to easily switch between the editor view & the preview view. This
is fully mobile ready & allows users to swipe between views.

The editor takes advantage of [React-MD] tabs & renders the markdown exactly how the user would see
the blog post.
