## What is a health check?

Health checks are a means to determine whether or not a particular instance of a microservice is
healthy and accessible.

Given the fine grained and horizontally scalable nature of microservices, its not uncommon to have
hundreds of instances of services running at any one moment. At scale it becomes impractical for an
operator to keep an eye on service response codes to ensure that everything is running correctly.

Typically a health check will be implemented as a combination of an endpoint `/health` and
infrastructure which repeatably hits that endpoint at set intervals. Most modern day infrastructure
such as your orchestrator, load balancer, api gateway or service registry can all cater for this
kind of monitoring.

Health checks provide a way for an application to introspect itself and determine if it can operate
correctly. Commonly, this means that an application can connect to its dependencies like a database,
message broker or cache; but it could also go further a determine that its business processes are
functioning correctly.

If the infrastructure determines that your application is unhealthy, it will kill the instance and
bring up a new one. You can consider it to be an automated microservice version of the image below.

## Implementing a health check

We'll add a `/health` endpoint to out Todo microservice from the [previous blogpost]. The source
code for the service is on [Github]. Our health endpoint will introspect the service and return a
http `200` if everything is ok, otherwise its unhealthy and should be stopped.

```go
// service.go
type TodoService interface {
    GetAllForUser(ctx context.Context, username string) ([]Todo, error)
    GetByID(ctx context.Context, id string) (Todo, error)
    Add(ctx context.Context, todo Todo) (Todo, error)
    Update(ctx context.Context, id string, todo Todo) error
    Delete(ctx context.Context, id string) error
    Health(ctx context.Context) error
}
```

Next we'll add the implementation for our in memory service. Typically a health check would contains
some network request pinging dependencies like a database. e.g.

```go
// Health perform service health check. verifies that DB is accessible
func (s *postgresService) Health(ctx context.Context) error {
    return s.db.PingContext(ctx)
}
```

But since our TodoService is in memory we'll perform a business process health check, by adding then
retrieving and finally deleting a Todo.

```go
// service.go
// Health check the In memory TodoService business process
func (s *inmemService) Health(ctx context.Context) error {
    todo := Todo{}
    addedTodo, err := s.Add(ctx, todo)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    retrievedTodo, err := s.GetByID(ctx, addedTodo.ID)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    if addedTodo != retrievedTodo {
        return errors.New("health check error retrieving todo")
    }
    return s.Delete(ctx, addedTodo.ID)
}
```

We would then create an endpoint in our `endpoint.go` like we did for the other service methods. Our
`HealthEndpoint` won't have any fields in its request or response structs. You could include any
health information you wanted in the response, for example the network response times of
dependencies, but just as long as your health check infrastructure knows hows to interpret it.

```go
// endpoint.go
type HealthRequest struct {
}

type HealthResponse struct {
}

func MakeHealthEndpoint(s TodoService) endpoint.Endpoint {
    return func(ctx context.Context, request interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
        err := s.Health(ctx)
        return HealthResponse{}, err
    }
}
```

Finally we add out out http transport endpoint. You may remember from the previous blogpost that
`encodeResponse` will return a `non 2xx` http status if an error is returned from the endpoint.

```go
// transport.go
router.Get("/health", httptransport.NewServer(
    endpoints.HealthEndpoint,
    decodeHealthRequest,
    encodeResponse,
    options...,
).ServeHTTP)
```

## Configuring health checks on Cloud Foundry

Cloud foundry's infrastructure can perform application monitoring to determine if the app should be
restarted or not. By default it will check that your app can receive connection on a its specified
`PORT`, which is a sensible default as adding your http listener is typically the last thing you'll
do during application start up. However, it is possible to configure it to use your service's own
health check endpoint.

This can vedone by adding a `health-check-type` of `http` and `health-check-http-endpoint` of your
health endpoint which in this case is `/health` to your `manifest.yml`. Cloud foundry expects a 200
response back within 1 second, otherwise it determines the app to be unhealthy and restarts it. The
default time between every health check is also configurable. It defaults to 60 seconds but it can
be configure to be as high a 180s.

```yaml
applications:
    - path: .
      name: TodoService
      command: ./TodoService
      buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack.git
      # Add health checks below
      health-check-type: http
      health-check-http-endpoint: /health
```

For more info see [Cloud Foundy health checks]

The result of above is that a http request is sent to `/health` every 60 seconds:
