## Dark theme

With youtube recently adding a dark mode to to their Polymer web app and rolling this feature out to
their android app in the last couple of days, I felt it was time to add a dark mode here. If you
spend as much time looking at a screen as me than you'll know that dark themes are a god send. They
can reduce the strain on your eyes and can even help those that struggle to get to sleep at night.

## Adding the Setting

Firstly we need a way for the user to toggle the dark theme. A new settings page was added to house
the dark theme toggle and all future settings, oh the possibilities!

### Settings component

Our settings component will have a single toggle switch that will control the dark theme. We're
using [React-MD] which nicely implements the Material Design spec & allows for a lot of style
customisation.

The component is fairly simple. As you can see from the `PropTypes`, it takes in the boolean value
for the dark theme & a function to call when the theme is when the theme is toggled. This component
is very much just a dumb view.

```jsx
// settings.component.jsx
import React from "react";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";
import "./Settings.css";
import Switch from "react-md/lib/SelectionControls/Switch";

export default class Settings extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="settings">
                <Switch
                    id="darkTheme"
                    type="switch"
                    label="Dark theme"
                    name="darkTheme"
                    labelBefore
                    checked={this.props.darkTheme}
                    onChange={this.props.handleDarkThemeChange}
                />
            </div>
        );
    }
}

Settings.propTypes = {
    darkTheme: PropTypes.bool,
    handleDarkThemeChange: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};
```

### Adding some logic and state

The components logic and stage is wired up using [ReduxJS]. We're using `mapStateToProps` to wire up
the dark theme value stored in the state to the `darkTheme` value passed into the component. Next
`mapDispatchToProps` specifies that we should dispatch the `toggleDarkTheme` function when our
components calls the `handleDarkThemeChange` function.

```jsx
// settings.container.jsx
import Settings from "core/components/Settings";
import { connect } from "react-redux";
import { isDarkTheme, toggleDarkTheme } from "core/ducks/settings";

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    darkTheme: isDarkTheme(state),
});

const mapDispatchToProps = {
    handleDarkThemeChange: toggleDarkTheme,
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Settings);
```

The settings redux file is following the [Ducks pattern] & includes a reducer registry as a nice way
to load reducers into the redux store asynchronously.

As reducers go, it's a fairly simple one. There's only one action, which is to toggle them dark
mode. The value of the dark theme is initially read from local storage and persisted back there
every time its toggled.

```js
// settings.ducks.js
import reducerRegistry from "core/redux/ReducerRegistry";

/*
 * Sidenav actions
 */
const TOGGLE_DARKTHEME = "TOGGLE_DARKTHEME";

/**
 * Reducer
 */
let initialState = {
    darkTheme: localStorage.getItem("darkTheme") === "true" || false,
};

export default function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case TOGGLE_DARKTHEME:
            let darkTheme = !state.darkTheme;
            localStorage.setItem("darkTheme", darkTheme);
            return {
                ...state,
                darkTheme: darkTheme,
            };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

/**
 * Action Creators
 */
export function toggleDarkTheme() {
    return {
        type: TOGGLE_DARKTHEME,
    };
}

/**
 * Selectors
 */
export function isDarkTheme(state) {
    return state.settings.darkTheme;
}

reducerRegistry.register("settings", reducer);
```

## Getting stylish

My root component - `App.jsx` is connected to the settings store and updates whenever the
`darkTheme` value updates. It simply adds a `.dark` class to the HTML element whenever darkTheme is
set. Various other sass files were updates to take this class into account.

The background colour and the text colour needed to be updated depending on the theme. E.g.

```css
// sass card component example with dark theme
@import "core/style/variable";
.card {
    background: $background-color-light;
}

.dark .card {
    background: $background-color-dark;
}
```

## Let there be dark
