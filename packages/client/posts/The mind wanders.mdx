## Silence is a virtue...

The challenge for this month was to do my daily commute in silence. My hope was that it would give
me time to think about the day in front of me, but also allow my mind to wander a bit and think
about other things that the rat race makes it difficult to find time for.

The reality wasn't quite as peaceful as I pictured it. Most mornings I could mentally create my
daily todo list within the first 5 minutes and this did turn out to be particularly useful. However,
allowing the mind to wander the rest of the journey is not something that I can recommend to anyone
whose commute is predominately done on a motorway. Motorways are a long boring straight road fill
will cars driving at high speeds, which on at non peak times can be a breeze to drive on, but during
rush hour traffic it's very common to go from 100km down to 10km very quickly. You need to be paying
attention! I noticed a dramatic drop in my reaction times mainly because I was away with the
fairies.

Across the month of commuting I managed to stick to the silence in all by 2 drives to work. These
mornings I was particularly tired and it was in my best interest to not attempt it. Both of those
mornings I listened to the [Guardian's Audio Long Reads] podcast, which I highly recommend listening
to. [The murder that shook Iceland] is particularly good "who done it" true story.

Meditation is quite often seen as a very peaceful easy walk in the park, but the reality is it
requires a lot of practice, patience and a tranquil environment to even allow yourself to clear your
mind. I'm not convince its for me yet, but I can definitely say that the daily commute is neither
the time of the place.
