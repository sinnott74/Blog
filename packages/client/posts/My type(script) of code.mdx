## Typescript

The technical goal for this month was to convert server for this blog from javascript to a
typescript. As this project grows & new features are added, it becomes quite difficult to prevent
inadvertent side affects. Test suites & good documentation can only bring a project so far, but the
ability to move quickly is paramount. The less time spent investigating how something works, the
more time there is to create solutions to real world problems.

### Migration

The migration to typescript was relatively painless and was done incrementally on a file by file
basis. I started by adding a fairly relaxed (not strict) `tsconfig.json`

```typescript
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "outDir": "./dist",
        "allowJs": true,
        "target": "es2017",
        "noImplicitAny": true,
    },
    "include": [
        "./src/**/*"
    ]
}
```

A build step then needs to be adde to convert your typescript to runnable javascript. A good
location for this is `package.json` but your gulp script, webpack config file or any other build
file could be used.

```javascript
"scripts": {
    "prestart": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js",
}
```

We can now slowly begin converting our files to typescript & slowly making our configuration more &
more strict to weed out any potential errors.

Microsoft has useful [migration documentation] on their typescript site.

### Features

Because typescript compiles to runnable javascript, it allows developers to use features that
haven't been implemented in NodeJS yet. A notable feature that I'm making use of in my ORM
infrastructure is [Decorators].

It allowed me to simply my model definition files & also allow the use of the models to by fully
typed. A quick comparison of the below files will allow you to see the difference & ease of
understanding that this feature provides.

#### Old javascript ORM entity file

```javascript
const ORM = require("sinnott-orm");
const DataTypes = ORM.DataTypes;

const User = ORM.define(
    "user",
    {
        username: {
            type: DataTypes.STRING,
            length: 30,
            notNull: true,
            unique: true,
        },
        firstname: {
            type: DataTypes.STRING,
            length: 30,
            notNull: true,
        },
        lastname: {
            type: DataTypes.STRING,
            length: 30,
            notNull: true,
        },
        dob: {
            type: DataTypes.TIMESTAMP,
            notNull: true,
        },
    },
    {
        customAttributes: {
            fullname: {
                get: function () {
                    return `${this.firstname} ${this.lastname}`;
                },
            },
        },
    },
);

User.isUsernameAvailable = async function (username) {
    let count = await User.count({ username });
    if (count > 0) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
};

User.readByUsername = async function (username) {
    return User.findOne({ username: username });
};

module.exports = User;
```

#### New typescript ORM entity file

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, DerivedColumn, BaseModel, STRING, TIMESTAMP } from "sinnott-orm-typed";
import InformationalException from "../exception/InformationalException";

@Entity()
export default class User extends BaseModel {
    @Column({ type: STRING, notNull: true, length: 30 })
    username: string;

    @Column({ type: STRING, notNull: true, length: 30 })
    firstname: string;

    @Column({ type: STRING, notNull: true, length: 30 })
    lastname: string;

    @Column({ type: TIMESTAMP, notNull: true })
    dob: Date;

    @DerivedColumn({
        get: function () {
            return `${this.firstname} ${this.lastname}`;
        },
    })
    fullname: string;

    async beforeSave() {
        const isUsernameAvailable = await User.isUsernameAvailable(this.username);
        if (!isUsernameAvailable) {
            throw new InformationalException("Duplicate username");
        }
    }

    /**
     * Checks if a username hasn't already been taken
     * @param username
     */
    static async isUsernameAvailable(username: string) {
        const count = await User.count({ username });
        return !(count > 0);
    }

    /**
     * Reads a User by their username
     * @param username
     */
    static async readByUsername(username: string) {
        return User.findOne<User>({ username: username });
    }
}
```

### Benchmarks

Strong typing may be a pleasure to work with from a development point of view, but if it impacted
performance of the application there would be major questions about whether it'd be worth it.

We can see from the benchmark results below that the performance of the javascript & typescript
versions of the server are virtually identical. This is largely expected. We're using NodeJS 9+ so
we can get access to the latest & greatest features. The transpilation from javascript to typescript
only really affects the import statements & the decorators used. If however we were to transpile
down to a version of javascript which doesn't support advanced language features like async await
for instance, the performance may take a hit.

The below benchmark was performed using [Apache Benchmark] (ab), which is was incredibly simple to
use.
