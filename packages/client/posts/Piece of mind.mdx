As the title suggest the goal for this month to gain some piece of mind. Websters defines it as:

> a feeling of being safe or protected

but I would go a little further and say piece of mind is about comfort and the ability to look
forward to the future without worry.

### Technical

#### Types & Tests

I've been using this blog to spur on in mainly the Javascript world. The skills that pay the bills
are primarily Java (and some proprietary enterprise technologies). Javascript is a hugely powerful &
flexible language that really it taking over the world. Let's not forget Atwood's law

> Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.

It's loosely typed nature can be very beneficial but as I plan for the future development it's very
difficult to shake the feeling that loose typing will inevitably lead to some in insidious bugs. The
paper [To Type or Not to Type] by Gao et al. 2017. found that a type system

> could have prevented 15% of the public bugs for public projects on GitHub.

A goal for this month to to migrate my sever to use Typescript instead of Javascript. This also
includes migrating my ORM infrastructure.

Secondly, as this has just been a personal project and not at an enterprise level. I've really
fallen short on expected tests & code coverage. Like the reasons for including type system above,
this will become a bigger problem down the line. My second technical goal for this month is to being
up my testing up to par

### Personal

#### The Morning Rush

I generally have a very nice commute into work. I drive and it takes roughly 30 minutes in the
morning & 50 in the evening. I sometimes get jealous of those that commute by bus or cycle. The bus
goers gain extra time to concentrate on what they'd like since they don't have to focus on the road.
The cyclist save time in the evening since they already have their exercise done.

I try to use my commute as effectively as I can. Focusing mainly on listening to podcasts instead of
morning/drive time radio nonsense.

My goal for this month is to do my morning commute in silence. I hope it will force me to think
about my day/week/month ahead & benefit me in the long run.
