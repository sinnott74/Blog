February will make the first real monthly challenge. The first month that I'll state at the
beginning what I'm attempting to do. While January was quite tough in the amount work that was
required, there was always a voice in the back of my head that said if I missed the deadline nobody
will know.

### Technical

#### The worlds most valuable resource

The technical challenge for February is a complete rewrite to how this blog interacts with a
database. The goal is to produce ORM like infrastructure tailored to my needed, with a longer term
goal (not in February) to using the data model to influence client screens. There's several widely
used and well documented ORMs in the javascript space. By using one of these I'll quickly be able to
generate & interact with my database, but the goal is to familiarise myself with the inner workings
of and problems faced by an ORM.

### Personal

#### Keep your chin Up

The personal challenge for February is to work on my posture and mobility. Having a desk job and
constantly working with a computer doesn't lend itself very well to having good posture or mobility.
These factors have an big influence in the quality of your later life, shown though the simple [sit
rising test].

It would be impossible for fully correct anyones posture in a month, so for this challenge I'm going
to focus on 3 key areas:

-   Hip flexibility
-   Rounded shoulders
-   Forward neck

While I may not hugely suffer from any of the above; learning about them and doing the various
exercises should have a positive effect on my life.
