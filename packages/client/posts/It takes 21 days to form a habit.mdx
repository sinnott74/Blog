## 2018 Monthly Challenges

The origin of magic 21 days figure came from a 1960s book called book ‘Psycho-cybernetics’ by Dr
Maxwell Maltz, a plastic surgeon turned psychologist.

> ‘It usually requires a minimum of about 21 days to effect any perceptible change in a mental
> image. Following plastic surgery it takes about 21 days for the average patient to get used to his
> new face. When an arm or leg is amputated the “phantom limb” persists for about 21 days. People
> must live in a new house for about three weeks before it begins to “seem like home”. These, and
> many other commonly observed phenomena tend to show that it requires a minimum of about 21 days
> for an old mental image to dissolve and a new one to jell.’

While there has been much research done to [dispel the 21 days habit myth] (best estimates have it
at around 66 days), its a nice idea to spark genuine change.

The primary driving force behind this blog was to challenge myself in 2018. As I mentioned in the
inaugural post, the name of the game is progressive enhancement.

I've selected two categories that will be my focus:

-   Technical
-   Personal

### Technical

Its easy to get into a lull when working with technology. You might have mastered all the skills
necessary to fully complete the 9-5, you compare favourably with your peers & you're happy with your
career trajectory.

There's no time to rest on your laurels or skills. Its widely accepted that not only is [technology
advancing], but that the advancement is accelerating.

### Personal

In 2010, Dave Brailsford took over as the General Manager and Performance Director for Team Sky, a
British professional cycling team. His philosophy was simple, it was called the [aggregation of
marginal gains]. His belief was that if you improved every area related to cycling by just 1
percent, then those small gains would add up to remarkable improvement. Ranging from which pillow
offered the best sleep to organising & colour coding water bottle. His goal was to put Team Sky in a
position to win the Tour De France in five years. They won it in three!

The theory goes that If I apply the same philosophy to my life, I should also see 'remarkable
improvement'. Of course I won't be applying the philosophy to the same professional pedantic degree.

'Personal' is an all encompassing category, that can range from what foods I eat to exercise or any
non technical skills I'd like to focus on.

   to progressively enhance it.
2. The monthly challenge should be outlined in a blog post before the 2nd of each month.
